permalink: /spec/1.1/
summary: "PGQL is an SQL-like query language for the Property Graph data model.
The language is based on the paradigm of graph pattern matching, which allows you to specify patterns that are matched against vertices and edges in a data graph.
Like SQL, PGQL has support for grouping (GROUP BY), aggregation (e.g. MIN, MAX, AVG, SUM), sorting (ORDER BY) and many other familiar SQL constructs.
In addition, PGQL has regular path expressions for applications such as reachability analysis."

## Breaking Syntax Changes since PGQL 1.0

 - The `WHERE` clause is changed into a `MATCH` clause and an optional `WHERE` clause such that the `MATCH` contains the pattern (vertices and edges) while the `WHERE` contains the filters if there are any.
   The inlined filters (`WITH` construct) should also be specified in the `WHERE` clause.
   For example, the following is a query in PGQL 1.0 and PGQL 1.1 syntax:

   ```sql
   /* PGQL 1.0 */
   SELECT n.name
    WHERE (n:Person WTIH age > 25)
        , n.age <= 35
   ```

   ```sql
   /* PGQL 1.1 */
   SELECT n.name
    MATCH (n:Person)
    WHERE n.age > 25
      AND n.age <= 35
   ```

 - The syntax for [common path expressions](#common-path-expressions) has changed as follows:

   ```bash
   # PGQL 1.0
   'PATH' IDENTIFIER ':=' PathPattern
   ```

   ```bash
   # PGQL 1.1
   'PATH' <IDENTIFIER> 'AS' <PathPattern> <WhereClause>?
   ```

   The changes are:

   - The symbol `:=` has changed into the keyword `AS`.
   - The inlined expressions (`WITH` construct) are moved to an optional `WHERE` clause.

   For example, the following is a query in both PGQL 1.0 (top) and PGQL 1.1 (bottom):

   ```sql
     /* PGQL 1.0 */
     PATH close_friend := () -[WITH weight >= 9]-> (:Person)
   SELECT m.name
    WHERE (n:Person) -/:close_friend*/-> (m)
        , n.name = 'Amber' 
   ```

   ```sql
     /* PGQL 1.1 */
     PATH close_friend AS () -[e]-> (:Person) WHERE e.weight >= 9
   SELECT m.name
    MATCH (n:Person) -/:close_friend*/-> (m)
    WHERE n.name = 'Amber'
   ```

 - Double-quoted string literals are no longer allowed; string literals should be single-quoted.

 - OO-style function call syntax has been replaced with SQL-style function call syntax:

   - `x.label()` => `label(x)`
   - `x.labels()` => `labels(x)`
   - `x.hasLabel(y)` => `has_label(x, y)`
   - `x.id()` => `id(x)`
   - `x.inDegree()` => `in_degree(x)`
   - `x.outDegree()` => `out_degree(x)`

 - The constructs `-->` (match any outgoing edge) and `<--` (match any incoming edge) are no longer allowed. Instead, use `->` and `<-`.

 - The infix Java RegExp operator `=~` has been removed. Instead, use the built-in function `java_regexp_like` (see [Built-in Functions](#built-in-functions)).

 - The `!` (logical not) operator has been removed. Instead, use `NOT` (logical not).

 - The `!=` (not equals) operator has been removed. Instead, use `<>` (not equals).

 - The `ASC(x)` (sort in ascending order) and `DESC(x)` (sort in descending order) functions have been removed. Instead, use the `x ASC` and `x DESC` constructs.

 - Direct sorting of vertices and edges (e.g. `ORDER BY v1, e1`) is no longer allowed. Instead, sort using _properties_ of vertices and edges (e.g. `ORDER BY v1.propX, e1.propY`).

# Introduction

PGQL (Property Graph Query Language) is a query language for the [property graph data model](#property-graph-data-model). This specification defines the syntax and semantics of PGQL.

Essentially, PGQL is a graph pattern-matching query language. A PGQL query describes a graph pattern consisting of vertices and edges. When the query is evaluated against a property graph, all the possible subgraphs that match the pattern are returned.

Consider the following example PGQL query:

```sql
SELECT m.name, o.name
  FROM sn_graph
 MATCH (n:Person) -[e1:friend_of]-> (m:Person) <-[e2:belongs_to]- (o:Car)
 WHERE n.name = 'John'
```

In the `FROM` clause, we specify the graph that is queried:

 - The input graph is named `sn_graph`

In the `MATCH` clause, the above query defines the pattern to be found.

 - The pattern has three vertices, `n`, `m` and `o`, and two edges, `e1` and `e2`.
 - The edge `e1` goes from `n` to `m` and the edge `e2` goes from `o` to `m`.
 - Vertices `n` and `m` have a label `Person`, while vertex `o` has a label `Car`.
 - Edges `e1` and `e2` have labels `friend_of` and `belongs_to` respectively.

The `WHERE` clause contains filters:

 - Vertex `n` has a property `name` with the value `John`.

The `SELECT` clause specifies what should be projected out from the query:

 - For each of the matched subgraphs, we project the property `name` of vertex `m` and the property `name` of vertex `o`.

## Property Graph Data Model

A property graph has a name, which is a (character) string, and contains:

 - A set of vertices (nodes).

   - Each vertex has zero or more labels.
   - Each vertex has zero or more properties, which are arbitrary key-value pairs.

 - A set of edges.

   - Each edge has a source and a destination vertex.
   - Each edge has zero or more labels.
   - Each edge has zero or more properties, which are arbitrary key-value pairs.

Labels as well as property names are strings. Property values are scalars such as numbers, strings or booleans.

Note: the property graph model in PGQL 1.1 does not support multi-valued properties like in [TinkerPop](http://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/current/reference/#vertex-properties),
or, composite types like in [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/docs/developer-manual/current/cypher/syntax/values/#composite-types).

## Basic Query Structure

The syntax of PGQL resembles that of SQL (Standard Query Language) of relational database systems. A basic PGQL query consists of the following clauses:

```bash
Query ::=
  <CommonPathExpressions>?
  <SelectClause>
  <FromClause>? <MatchClause>
  <WhereClause>?
  <GroupByClause>? <HavingClause>?
  <OrderByClause>?
  <LimitOffsetClauses>?
```

The most important ones are as follows:

- The `SelectClause` defines the data entities that are returned in the result.
- The `MatchClause` defines the graph pattern that is matched against the data graph instance.
- The `WhereClause` defines the filters. 

The detailed syntax and semantic of each clause are explained in following sections.

# Graph Pattern Matching

In a PGQL query, the `MATCH` clause defines the graph pattern to be matched.

Syntactically, a `MATCH` clause is composed of the keyword `MATCH` followed by a comma-separated sequence of path patterns.

```bash
MatchClause         ::= 'MATCH' {<PathPattern> ','}+
PathPattern         ::= <Vertex> (<Relation> <Vertex>)*
Vertex              ::= '(' <VariableDeclaration> ')'
Relation            ::= <Edge>
                      | <Path>
Edge                ::= <OutgoingEdge>
                      | <IncomingEdge>
                      | <UndirectedEdge>
OutgoingEdge        ::= '->'
                      | '-[' <VariableDeclaration> ']->'
IncomingEdge        ::= '<-'
                      | '<-[' <VariableDeclaration> ']-'
UndirectedEdge      ::= '-'
                      | '-[' <VariableDeclaration> ']-'
VariableDeclaration ::= <VariableName>? <LabelsPredicate>?
VariableName        ::= <IDENTIFIER>
LabelsPredicate     ::= ':' {<Label> '|'}+
WhereClause         ::= 'WHERE' <ValueExpression>
```

A path pattern describes a partial topology of the subgraph pattern, i.e. vertices and edges in the pattern.

There can be multiple path patterns in the `MATCH` clause of a PGQL query. Semantically, all constraints are conjunctive â€“ that is, each matched result should satisfy every constraint in the `MATCH` clause.

## Input Graph (FROM)

The `FROM` clause specifies the name of the input graph to be queried:

```bash
FromClause ::= 'FROM' <IDENTIFIER>
```

The `FROM` clause may be omitted if the system does not require the specification of an input graph for reasons such as:

 - The input graph is implicit because the system only handles single graphs.
 - The system has a notion of a "default graph" like in certain SPARQL systems.
 - The system provides an API such as `Graph.queryPgql(..)`, such that it is already clear from the context what the input graph is.

Subqueries may have their own `FROM` clause (see [Querying Multiple Graphs](#querying-multiple-graphs)). Subqueries may also omit the `FROM` clause (see [Subqueries without FROM Clause](#subqueries-without-from-clause)).

## Topology Constraints

A topology constraint is a path pattern that describes a partial topology of the subgraph pattern. In other words, a topology constraint describes some connectivity relationships between vertices and edges in the pattern, whereas the whole topology of the pattern is described with one or multiple topology constraints.

A topology constraint is composed of one or more vertices and relations, where a relation is either an edge or a path. In a query, each vertex or edge is (optionally) associated with a variable, which is a symbolic name to reference the vertex or edge in other clauses. For example, consider the following topology constraint:

```sql
(n) -[e]-> (m)
```

The above example defines two vertices (with variable names `n` and `m`), and an edge (with variable name `e`) between them. Also the edge is directed such that the edge `e` is an outgoing edge from vertex `n`.

More specifically, a vertex term is written as a variable name inside a pair of parenthesis `()`. An edge term is written as a variable name inside a square bracket `[]` with two dashes and an inequality symbol attached to it â€“ which makes it look like an arrow drawn in ASCII art. An edge term is always connected with two vertex terms as for the source and destination vertex of the edge; the source vertex is located at the tail of the ASCII arrow and the destination at the head of the ASCII arrow.

### Repeated Variables in Multiple Topology Constraints

There can be multiple topology constraints in the `WHERE` clause of a PGQL query. In such a case, vertex terms that have the same variable name correspond to the same vertex entity. For example, consider the following two lines of topology constraints:

```sql
(n) -[e1]-> (m1),
(n) -[e2]-> (m2)
```

Here, the vertex term `(n)` in the first constraint indeed refers to the same vertex as the vertex term `(n)` in the second constraint. It is an error, however, if two edge terms have the same variable name, or, if the same variable name is assigned to an edge term as well as to a vertex term in a single query.

### Syntactic Sugars for Topology Constraints

For user's convenience, PGQL provides several syntactic sugars (short-cuts) for topology constraints.

First, a single topology constraint can be written as a chain of edge terms such that two consecutive edge terms share the common vertex term in between. For instance, the following topology constraint is valid in PGQL:

```sql
(n1)-[e1]->(n2)-[e2]->(n3)-[e3]->(n4)
```

In fact, the above constraint is equivalent to the following set of comma-separated constraints:

```sql
(n1) -[e1]-> (n2),
(n2) -[e2]-> (n3),
(n3) -[e3]-> (n4)
```

Second, PGQL syntax allows to reverse the direction of an edge in the query, i.e. right-to-left instead of left-to-right. Therefore, the following is a valid topology constraint in PGQL:

```sql
(n1) -[e1]-> (n2) <-[e2]- (n3)
```

Please mind the edge directions in the above query â€“ vertex `n2` is a common outgoing neighbor of both vertex `n1` and vertex `n3`.

Third, PGQL allows to omit not-interesting variable names in the query. A variable name is not interesting if that name would not appear in any other constraint, nor in other clauses (`SelectClause`, `SolutionModifierClause`). As for a vertex term, only the variable name is omitted, resulting in an empty parenthesis pair. In case of an edge term, the whole square bracket is omitted in addition to the variable name. In this case, the remaining ASCII arrow can have either one dash or two dashes.

The following table summarizes these short cuts.

Syntax form | Example
--- | ---
Basic form | `(n) -[e]-> (m)`
Omit variable name of the source vertex | `() -[e]-> (m)`
Omit variable name of the destination vertex | `(n) -[e]-> ()`
Omit variable names in both vertices | `() -[e]-> ()`
Omit variable name in edge | `(n) -> (m)`

### Disconnected Topology Constraints

In the case the topology constraints form multiple groups of vertices and edges that are not connected to each other, the semantic is that the different groups are matched independently and that the final result is produced by taking the Cartesian product of the result sets of the different groups. The following is an example of a query that will result in a Cartesian product.

```sql
SELECT *
 MATCH (n1) -> (m1)
     , (n2) -> (m2) /* vertices {n2, m2} are not connected to vertices {n1, m1}, resulting in a Cartesian product */
```

## Label Matching

In the property graph model, vertices and edge may have labels. These are typicalyl used to encode the type of the entity, e.g. `Person` or `Movie` for vertices and `likes` for edges. PGQL provides a convenient syntax for matching labels by attaching the label to the corresponding vertex or edge using a colon (`:`) followed by the label. Take the following example:

```sql
SELECT *
 MATCH (x:Person) -[e:likes]-> (y:Person)
```

Here, we specify that vertices `x` and `y` have the label `Person` and that the edge `e` has the label `likes`.

Labels can still be specified when variables are omitted. The following is an example:

```sql
SELECT *
 MATCH (:Person) -[:likes]-> (:Person)
```

### Labels and Quotes

Labels can be arbitrary strings. Omitting quotes is optional only if the label is an alphanumeric character followed by zero or more alphanumeric or underscore characters. Otherwise, the label needs to be quoted and Syntax for Strings needs to be followed. This is explained by the following grammar constructs:

```bash
Label ::= <IDENTIFIER>
```

Take the following example:

```sql
SELECT *
 MATCH (x:Person) -[e:"has friend"]-> (y:Person)
```

Here, because the label `has friend` contains a white space, the quotes cannot be omitted and syntax for quoted identifiers is required.

### Label Alternatives

One can specify label alternatives, such that the pattern matches if the vertex or edge has one of the specified labels. Syntax-wise, label alternatives are separated by a `|` character, as follows:

```sql
SELECT *
 MATCH (x:Student|Professor) -[e:likes|knows]-> (y:Student|Professor)
```

Here, vertices `x` and `y` match if they have either or both of labels `Student` and `Professor`. Edge `e` matches if it has either label `likes` or label `knows`.


### Built-in Functions for Labels

There are also built-in functions available for labels:

- `has_label(element, string)` returns `true` if the vertex or edge (first argument) has the specified label (second argument).
- `labels(element)` returns the set of labels of a vertex or edge in the case the vertex/edge has multiple labels.
- `label(element)` returns the label of a vertex or edge in the case the vertex/edge has only a single label.

## Filters

Filters describe general constraints other than topology. A filter takes the form of a boolean expression which typically involves certain property values of the vertices and edges that are defined in topology constraints in the same query. For instance, the following example consists of three constraints â€“ one topology constraint followed by two value constraints.

```sql
SELECT y.name
MATCH (x) -> (y)
WHERE x.name = 'John'
  AND y.age > 25
```

In the above example, the first filter describes that the vertex `x` has a property `name` and its value is `John`. Similarly, the second value describes that the vertex `y` has a property `age` and its value is larger than `25`. Here, in the filter, the dot (`.`) operator is used for property access. For the detailed syntax and semantic of expressions, please see [value expressions](#value-expressions).

Note that in PGQL the ordering of constraints does not has any effect on the result. Therefore, the previous example is equivalent to the following:

```sql
SELECT y.name
MATCH (x) -> (y)
WHERE y.age > 25
  AND x.name = 'John'
```

## Graph Pattern Matching Semantic

There are two popular graph pattern matching semantics: graph homomorphism and graph isomorphism. The semantic of PGQL is graph homomorphism.

### Subgraph Homomorphism

Under graph homomorphism, multiple vertices (or edges) in the query pattern may match with the same vertex (or edge) in the data graph as long as all topology and value constraints of the different query vertices (or edges) are satisfied by the data vertex (or edge).

Consider the following example graph and query:

```
Vertex 0
Vertex 1
Edge 0: 0 -> 0
Edge 1: 0 -> 1
```

```sql
SELECT x, y
 MATCH (x) -> (y)
```

Under graph homomorphism the output of this query is as follows:

x | y
--- | ---
0 | 0
0 | 1

Note that in case of the first result, both query vertex `x` and query vertex `y` are bound to the same data vertex `0`.

### Subgraph Isomorphism

Under graph isomorphism, two distinct query vertices must not match with the same data vertex.

Consider the example from above. Under graph isomorphism, only the second solution is a valid one since the first solution binds both query vertices `x` and `y` to the same data vertex.

In PGQL, to specify that a pattern should be matched in an isomorphic way, one can introduce either non-equality constraints:

```sql
SELECT x, y
 MATCH (x) -> (y)
 WHERE x <> y
```

The output of this query is as follows:

x | y
--- | ---
0 | 1

## Undirected Query Edges

Undirected query edges match with both incoming and outgoing data edges.

An example PGQL query with undirected edges is as follows:

```sql
SELECT *
 MATCH (n) -[e1]- (m) -[e2]- (o)
```

Note that in case there are both incoming and outgoing data edges between two data vertices, there will be separate result bindings for each of the edges.

Undirected edges may also be used inside [common path expressions](#common-path-expressions):

```sql
  PATH two_hops AS () -[e1]- () -[e2]- ()
SELECT *
 MATCH (n) -/:two_hops*/-> (m)
```

The above query will return all pairs of vertices `n` and `m` that are reachable via a multiple of two edges, each edge being either an incoming or an outgoing edge.

# Table Operations

## Projection (SELECT)

In a PGQL query, the SELECT clause defines the data entities to be returned in the result. In other words, the select clause defines the columns of the result table.

The following explains the syntactic structure of SELECT clause.

```bash
SelectClause ::= 'SELECT' <DISTINCT>? {<ExpAsVar> ','}+
               | 'SELECT' '*'

DISTINCT     ::= 'DISTINCT'

ExpAsVar     ::= <ValueExpression> ('AS' <VariableName>)?
```

A `SELECT` clause consists of the keyword `SELECT` followed by either an optional `<DISTINCT>` modifier and comma-separated sequence of `<ExpAsVar>` ("expression as variable") elements, or, a special character star `*`. An `<ExpAsVar>` consists of:

- A `<ValueExpression>`.
- An optional `<VariableName>`, specified by appending the keyword `AS` and the name of the variable.

Consider the following example:

```sql
SELECT n, m, n.age AS age
 MATCH (n:Person) -[e:friend_of]-> (m:Person)
```

Per each matched subgraph, the query returns two vertices `n` and `m` and the value for property age of vertex `n`.  Note that edge `e` is omitted from the result even though it is used for describing the pattern.

The `DISTINCT` modifier allows for filtering out duplicate results. The operation applies to an entire result row, such that rows are only considered duplicates of each other if they contain the same set of values.

### Assigning Variable Name to Select Expression

It is possible to assign a variable name to any of the selection expression, by appending the keyword `AS` and a variable name. The variable name is used as the column name of the result set. In addition, the variable name can be later used in the `ORDER BY` clause. See the related section later in this document.

```sql
  SELECT n.age * 2 - 1 AS pivot, n.name, n
   MATCH (n:Person) -> (m:Car)
ORDER BY pivot
```

### SELECT *

`SELECT *` is a special `SELECT` clause. The semantic of `SELECT *` is to select all the (non-anonymous) variables in the graph pattern.

`SELECT *` in combination with `GROUP BY` is not allowed.

Consider the following query:

```sql
SELECT *
 MATCH (n:Person) -> (m) -> (w)
     , (n) -> (w) -> (m)
```

The query is semantically equivalent to:

```sql
SELECT n, m, w
 MATCH (n:Person) -> (m) -> ()
     , (n) -> (w) -> (m)
```

It is allowed to have a `SELECT *` even in the case the `MATCH` clause contains only anonymous variables:

```sql
SELECT *
 MATCH () -> ()
```

This leads to a result table with zero columns. However, the table will still have as many rows as there are matches to the pattern.

## Sorting (ORDER BY)

When there are multiple matched subgraph instances to a given query, in general, the ordering between those instances are not defined; the query execution engine can present the result in any order. Still, the user can specify the ordering between the answers in the result using `ORDER BY` clause.

The following explains the syntactic structure of `ORDER BY` clause.

```bash
OrderByClause ::= 'ORDER' 'BY' {<OrderTerm> ','}+
OrderTerm     ::= <ValueExpression> ('ASC'|'DESC')?
```

The `ORDER BY` clause starts with the keywords `ORDER BY` and is followed by comma separated list of order terms. An order term consists of the following parts:

 - An expression.
 - An optional ASC or DESC decoration to specify that ordering should be ascending or descending.
     - If no keyword is given, the default is ascending order.

The following is an example in which the results are ordered by property access `n.age` in ascending order:

```sql
  SELECT n.name
   MATCH (n:Person)
ORDER BY n.age ASC
```

### Multiple Terms in ORDER BY

It is possible that `ORDER BY` clause consists of multiple terms. In such a case, these terms are evaluated from left to right. That is, (n+1)th ordering term is used only for the tie-break rule for n-th ordering term. Note that each term can have different ascending or descending decorator.

```sql
  SELECT f.name
   MATCH (f:Person)
ORDER BY f.age ASC, f.salary DESC
```

### Data Types for ORDER BY

A partial ordering is defined for the different data types as follows:

- Numeric data values are ordered from small to large.
- Strings are ordered lexicographically.
- Boolean values are ordered such that `false` comes before `true`
- Temporal data types (dates, time, timestamps) are ordered such that earlier points in time come before later points in time.

Vertices and edges cannot be ordered.

## Pagination (LIMIT and OFFSET)

The `LIMIT` puts an upper bound on the number of solutions returned, whereas the `OFFSET` specifies the start of the first solution that should be returned.

The following explains the syntactic structure for the LIMIT and OFFSET clauses:

```bash
LimitOffsetClauses ::= 'LIMIT' <UNSIGNED_INTEGER> ('OFFSET' <UNSIGNED_INTEGER>)?
                     | 'OFFSET' <UNSIGNED_INTEGER> ('LIMIT' <UNSIGNED_INTEGER>)?
```

The `LIMIT` clause starts with the keyword `LIMIT` and is followed by an integer that defines the limit. Similarly, the `OFFSET` clause starts with the keyword `OFFSET` and is followed by an integer that defines the offset. Furthermore:
The `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` clauses can be defined in either order.
The limit and offset may not be negatives.
The following semantics hold for the `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` clauses:
The `OFFSET` clause is always applied first, even if the `LIMIT` clause is placed before the `OFFSET` clause inside the query.
An `OFFSET` of zero has no effect and gives the same result as if the `OFFSET` clause was omitted.
If the number of actual solutions after `OFFSET` is applied is greater than the limit, then at most the limit number of solutions will be returned.

In the following query, the first 5 intermediate solutions are pruned from the result (i.e. `OFFSET 5`). The next 10 intermediate solutions are returned and become final solutions of the query (i.e. `LIMIT 10`).

```sql
SELECT n
 MATCH (n)
 LIMIT 10
OFFSET 5
```

# Regular Path Expressions

Path queries test for the existence of arbitrary-length paths between pairs of vertices, or, retrieve actual paths between pairs of vertices.
PGQL 1.1 supports testing for path existence ("reachability testing") only, while retrieval of actual paths between reachable pairs of vertices is planned for a future version.

The syntactic structure of a query path is similar to a query edge, but it uses forward slashes (-/.../->) instead of square brackets (-[...]->). The syntax rules are as follows:

```bash
Path                 ::= <OutgoingPath>
                       | <IncomingPath>

OutgoingPath         ::= '-/' <LabelsPredicate> '/->'
                       | '-/' <SingleLabelPredicate> <RepetitionQuantifier> '/->'

IncomingPath         ::= '<-/' <LabelsPredicate> '/-'
                       | '<-/' <SingleLabelPredicate> <RepetitionQuantifier> '/-'

SingleLabelPredicate ::= ':' <IDENTIFIER>

RepetitionQuantifier ::= <ZeroOrMore>
                       | <OneOrMore>
                       | <Optional>
                       | <ExactlyN>
                       | <NOrMore>
                       | <BetweenNAndM>
                       | <BetweenZeroAndM>

ZeroOrMore           ::= '*'
OneOrMore            ::= '+'
Optional             ::= '?'
ExactlyN             ::= '{' <UNSIGNED_INTEGER> '}'
NOrMore              ::= '{' <UNSIGNED_INTEGER> ',' '}'
BetweenNAndM         ::= '{' <UNSIGNED_INTEGER> ',' <UNSIGNED_INTEGER> '}'
BetweenZeroAndM      ::= '{' ',' <UNSIGNED_INTEGER> '}'
```

An example is as follows:

```sql
SELECT c.name
 MATCH (c:Class) -/:subclass_of*/-> (arrayList:Class)
 WHERE arrayList.name = 'ArrayList'
```

Here, we find all classes that are a subclass of `'ArrayList'`. The regular path pattern `subclass_of*` matches a path consisting of zero or more edges with the label `subclass_of`. Because the pattern may match a path with zero edges, the two query vertices can be bound to the same data vertex if the data vertex satisfies the constraints specified in both source and destination vertices (i.e. the vertex has a label `Class` and a property `name` with a value `ArrayList`.

## Min and max repetition

Quantifiers in regular path expressions allow for specifying lower and upper limits on the number of times a path expression should match.

| quantifier | meaning                              | matches                                                                                                                             | example path        |
|------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| *          | zero (0) or more                     | A path that connects the source and destination of the path by zero or more matches of a given pattern.                             | `-/:lbl*/->`        |
| +          | one (1) or more                      | A path that connects the source and destination of the path by one or more matches of a given pattern.                              | `-/:lbl+/->`        |
| ?          | zero or one (1), i.e. "optional"     | A path that connects the source and destination of the path by zero or one matches of a given pattern.                              | `-/:lbl?/->`        |
| { n }      | exactly _n_                          | A path that connects the source and destination of the path by exactly _n_ matches of a given pattern.                              | `-/:lbl{2}/->`      |
| { n, }     | _n_ or more                          | A path that connects the source and destination of the path by at least _n_ matches of a given pattern.                             | `-/:lbl{2,}/->`     |
| { n, m }   | between _n_ and _m_ (inclusive)      | A path that connects the source and destination of the path by at least _n_ and at most _m_ (inclusive) matches of a given pattern. | `-/:lbl{2,3}/->                      ` |
| { , m }    | between zero (0) and _m_ (inclusive) | A path that connects the source and destination of the path by at least 0 and at most _m_ (inclusive) matches of a given pattern.   | `-/:lbl{,3}/->`     |

Paths considered include those that repeat the same vertices and/or edges multiple times. This means that even cycles are considered. However, because the semantic is to test for the existence of paths between pairs of vertices, there is only at most one result per pair of vertices. Thus, even though an unbounded number of paths may exist between a pair of vertices (because of cycles), the result is always bounded.

### Examples

Take the following graph as example:

{% include image.html file="example_graphs/pgql_min_max_hop.png" %}

#### Zero or more

The following query finds all vertices `y` that can be reached from `Amy` by following zero or more `likes` edges.

```sql
SELECT y.name
 MATCH (x:Person) -/:likes*/-> (y)
 WHERE x.name = 'Amy'
```

```
+--------+
| y.name |
+--------+
| Amy    |
| John   |
| Albert |
| Judith |
+--------+
```

Note that here, `Amy` is returned since `Amy` connects to `Amy` by following zero `likes` edges. In other words, there exists an empty path for the vertex pair.
For `Judith`, there exist two paths (`100 -> 200 -> 300 -> 400` and `100 -> 400`). However, `Judith` is still only returned once.

#### One or more

The following query finds all people that can be reached from `Amy` by following one or more `likes` edges.

```sql
SELECT y.name
 MATCH (x:Person) -/:likes+/-> (y)
 WHERE x.name = 'Amy'
```

```
+--------+
| y.name |
+--------+
| John   |
| Albert |
| Judith |
+--------+
```

This time, `Amy` is not returned since there doesn't exist a path that connects `Amy` to `Amy` that has a length greater than zero.

Another example is a query that finds all people that can be reached from `Judith` by following one or more `knows` edges:

```sql
SELECT y.name
 MATCH (x:Person) -/:knows+/-> (y)
 WHERE x.name = 'Judith'
```

```
+--------+
| y.name |
+--------+
| Jonas  |
| Judith |
+--------+
```

Here, in addition to `Jonas`, `Judith` is returned since there exist paths from `Judith` back to `Judith` that has a length greater than zero. Examples of such paths are `400 -> 500 -> 400` and `400 -> 500 -> 400 -> 500 -> 400`.

#### Optional

The following query finds all people that can be reached from `Judith` by following zero or one `knows` edges.

```sql
SELECT y.name
 MATCH (x:Person) -/:knows?/-> (y)
 WHERE x.name = 'Judith'
```

```
+--------+
| y.name |
+--------+
| Judith |
| Jonas  |
+--------+
```

Here, `Judith` is returned since there exists the empty path that starts in `400` and ends in `400`. `Jonas` is returned because of the following path that has length one: `400 -> 500`.

#### Exactly n

The following query finds all people that can be reached from `Amy` by following 2 or more `likes` edges.

```sql
SELECT y.name
 MATCH (x:PersoN) -/:likes{2,}/-> (y)
 WHERE x.name = 'Amy'
```

```
+--------+
| y.name |
+--------+
| Albert |
| Judith |
+--------+
```
Here, `Albert` is returned since there exists the following path of length two: `100 -> 200 -> 300`. `Judith` is returned since there exists a path of length three: `100 -> 200 -> 300 -> 400`.

#### n or more

The following query finds all people that can be reached from `Amy` by following between 1 and 2 `likes` edges.

```sql
SELECT y.name
 MATCH (x:Person) -/:likes{1,2}/-> (y)
 WHERE x.name = 'Amy'
```

```
+--------+
| y.name |
+--------+
| John   |
| Albert |
| Judith |
+--------+
```
 
Here, `John` is returned since there exists a path of length one (i.e. `100 -> 200`);
`Albert` is returned since there exists a path of length two (i.e. `100 -> 200 -> 300`);
`Judith` is returned since there exists a path of length one (i.e. `100 -> 400`).

#### Between zero and m

The following query finds all people that can be reached from `Judith` by following at most 2 `knows` edges.

```sql
SELECT y.name
 MATCH (x:Person) -/:knows{,2}/-> (y)
 WHERE x.name = 'Judith'
```

```
+--------+
| y.name |
+--------+
| Jonas  |
| Judith |
+--------+
```

Here, `Jonas` is returned since there exists a path of length one (i.e. `400 -> 500`).
For `Judith`, there exists an empty path of length zero (i.e. `400`) as well as a non-empty path of length two (i.e. `400 -> 500 -> 400`).
Yet, `Judith` is only returned once.

## Common Path Expressions

One or more "common path expression" may be declared at the beginning of the query. These can be seen as macros that allow for expressing complex regular expressions.

```bash
CommonPathExpressions ::= <CommonPathExpression>+

CommonPathExpression  ::= 'PATH' <IDENTIFIER> 'AS' <PathPattern> <WhereClause>?
```

A path pattern declaration starts with the keyword `PATH`, followed by an expression name, the assignment operator `AS`, and a path pattern consisting ofat least one vertex. The syntactic structure of the path pattern is the same as a path pattern in the `MATCH` clause.

An example is as follows:

```sql
  PATH has_parent AS () -[:has_father|has_mother]-> (:Person)
SELECT ancestor.name
 MATCH (p1:Person) -/:has_parent+/-> (ancestor),
     , (p2:Person) -/:has_parent+/-> (ancestor)
 WHERE p1.name = 'Mario'
   AND p2.name = 'Luigi'
```

The above query finds common ancestors of `Mario` and `Luigi`.

Another example is as follows:

```sql
  PATH connects_to AS (:Generator) -[:has_connector]-> (c:Connector) <-[:has_connector]- (:Generator)
                WHERE c.status = 'OPERATIONAL'
SELECT generatorA.location, generatorB.location
 MATCH (generatorA) -/:connects_to+/-> (generatorB)
```

The above query outputs all generators that are connected to each other via one or more connectors that are all operational.

# Grouping and Aggregation

## Grouping

`GROUP BY` allows for grouping of solutions and is typically used in combination with aggregation to aggregate over groups of solutions instead of over the total set of solutions.

The following explains the syntactic structure of the `GROUP BY` clause:

```bash
GroupByClause ::= 'GROUP' 'BY' {<ExpAsVar> ','}+
```

The `GROUP BY` clause starts with the keywords GROUP BY and is followed by a comma-separated list of group terms. Each group term consists of:

- An expression.
- An optional variable definition that is specified by appending the keyword AS and the name of the variable.

Consider the following query:

```sql
  SELECT n.firstName, COUNT(*), AVG(n.age)
   MATCH (n:Person)
GROUP BY n.firstName
```

Matches are grouped by their values for `n.firstName`. For each group, the query selects `n.firstName` (i.e. the group key), the number of solutions in the group (i.e. `COUNT(*)`), and the average value of the property age for vertex n (i.e. `AVG(n.age)`).

### Assigning Variable Name to Group Expression

It is possible to assign a variable name to any of the group expression, by appending the keyword `AS` and a variable name. The variable name can be used in the `SELECT` to select a group key, or in the `ORDER BY` to order by a group key. See the related section later in this document.

```sql
  SELECT nAge, COUNT(*)
   MATCH (n:Person)
GROUP BY n.age AS nAge
ORDER BY nAge
```

### Multiple Terms in GROUP BY

It is possible that the `GROUP BY` clause consists of multiple terms. In such a case, matches are grouped together only if they hold the same result for each of the group expressions.

Consider the following query:

```sql
  SELECT n.firstName, n.lastName, COUNT(*)
   MATCH (n:Person)
GROUP BY n.firstName, n.lastName
```

Matches will be grouped together only if they hold the same values for `n.firstName` and the same values for `n.lastName`.

### GROUP BY and NULL values

The group for which all the group keys are null is a valid group and takes part in further query processing.

To filter out such a group, use a [`HAVING` clause](#filtering-of-groups-having), for example:

```sql
  SELECT n.prop1, n.prop2, COUNT(*)
   MATCH (n)
GROUP BY n.prop1, n.prop2
  HAVING n.prop1 IS NOT NULL
     AND n.prop2 IS NOT NULL
```

### Repetition of Group Expression in Select or Order Expression

Group expressions that are variable accesses, property accesses, or built-in function calls may be repeated in select or order expressions. This is a short-cut that allows you to neglect introducing new variables for simple expressions.

Consider the following query:

```sql
  SELECT n.age, COUNT(*)
   MATCH (n)
GROUP BY n.age
ORDER BY n.age
```

Here, the group expression `n.age` is repeated as select and order expressions.

This repetition of group expressions introduces an exception to the variable visibility rules described above, since variable n is not inside an aggregation in the select/order expression. However, semantically, the query is treated as if there were a variable for the group expression:

```sql
  SELECT nAge, COUNT(*)
   MATCH (n)
GROUP BY n.age AS nAge
ORDER BY nAge
```

## Aggregation

Instead of retrieving all the matched results, a PGQL query can choose to get only some aggregated information about the result. This is done by putting aggregations in SELECT clause. Consider the following example query which returns the average value of property age over all the matched vertex m.

```sql
SELECT AVG(m.age)
 MATCH (m:Person)
```

The syntax is as follows:

```bash
Aggregation      ::= CountAggregation
                   | MinAggregation
                   | MaxAggregation
                   | AvgAggregation
                   | SumAggregation

CountAggregation ::= 'COUNT' '(' '*' ')'
                   | 'COUNT' '(' <DISTINCT>? <ValueExpression> ')'

MinAggregation   ::= 'MIN' '(' <DISTINCT>? <ValueExpression> ')'

MaxAggregation   ::= 'MAX' '(' <DISTINCT>? <ValueExpression> ')'

AvgAggregation   ::= 'AVG' '(' <DISTINCT>? <ValueExpression> ')'

SumAggregation   ::= 'SUM' '(' <DISTINCT>? <ValueExpression> ')'
```

Syntactically, an aggregation takes the form of aggregate followed by an optional `DISTINCT` modifier and a `<ValueExpression>`.

The following table gives an overview of the different aggregates and their supported input types.

Aggregate Operator | Semantic | Required Input Type
--- | --- | ---
`COUNT` | counts the number of times the given expression has a bound (i.e. is not null). | any type, including vertex and edge
`MIN` | takes the minimum of the values for the given expression. | numeric, string, date, time (with timezone), or, timestamp (with timezone)
`MAX` | takes the maximum of the values for the given expression. | numeric, string, date, time (with timezone), or, timestamp (with timezone)
`SUM` | sums over the values for the given expression. | numeric
`AVG` | takes the average of the values for the given. | numeric

The `DISTINCT` modifier specifies that duplicate values should be removed before aggregation.

`COUNT(*)` is a special syntax to count the number of pattern matches, without specifying an expressions. Consider the following example:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
 MATCH (m:Person) -> (k:Car) <- (n:Person)
```

The above query simply returns the number of matches to the pattern.

### Aggregation and Required Input Type

In PGQL, aggregation is performed only for the matched results where the type of the target expression matches with the required input type. Consider an example graph instance which has the following four vertex entities.

```
{"id": 3048,  "name":"John",  "age":30}
{"id": 1197,  "name":"Peter", "age":20}
{"id": 20487, "name":"Paul",  "age":"thirty five"}
{"id": 2019,  "name":"James"}
```

Now suppose the following query is applied on this data set.

```sql
SELECT AVG(n.age), COUNT(*)
 MATCH (n)
```

Note that all the vertices are matched by the `WHERE` clause. However, the aggregation result from `SELECT` clause is `25` and `4`. For `AVG(n.age)` aggregation, only two vertices get aggregated (`"John"` and `"Peter"`) â€“ the vertex for `"Paul"` is not applied because `'age'` is not numeric type, and the vertex for `"James"` does not have `'age'` property at all. For `COUNT(*)` aggregation, on the other hand, all the four matched vertices are applied to the aggregation.

### Aggregation and Solution Modifier

Aggregation is applied only afterthe  `GROUP BY` operator is applied, but before the `OFFSET` and `LIMIT` operators are applied.

- If there is no GROUP BY operator, the aggregation is performed over the whole match results.
- If there is a GROUP BY operator, the aggregation is applied over each group.

See the detailed syntax and semantics of `SolutionModifierClause` in the related section of this specification.

### Assigning Variable Name to Aggregation

Like normal selection expression, it is also possible to assign variable name to aggregations. Again this is done by appending the key word `AS` and a variable name next to the aggregation. The variable name is used as the column name of the result set. In addition, the variable name can be later used in the `ORDER BY` clause. See the related section later in this document.

```sql
  SELECT AVG(n.age) AS pivot, COUNT(n)
   MATCH (n:Person) -> (m:Car)
GROUP BY n.hometown
ORDER BY pivot
```

## Filtering of Groups (HAVING)

The `HAVING` clause is an optional clause that can be placed after a `GROUP BY` clause to filter out particular groups of solutions.
The syntactic structure is as follows:

```bash
HavingClause ::= 'HAVING' {<ValueExpression> ','}+
```

An example is as follows:

```sql
  SELECT n.name
   MATCH (n) -[:has_friend]-> (m)
GROUP BY n
  HAVING COUNT(m) > 10
```

This query returns the names of people who have more than 10 friends.

# Value Expressions

Expressions are used in value constraints, in-lined constraints, and select/group/order terms. This section of the document defines the operators and built-in functions that can be used as part of an expression.

```bash
ValueExpression          ::= <VariableReference>
                           | <PropertyAccess>
                           | <Literal>
                           | <BindVariable>
                           | <ArithmeticExpression>
                           | <RelationalExpression>
                           | <LogicalExpression>
                           | <BracketedValueExpression>
                           | <CastSpecification>
                           | <FunctionCall>
                           | <IsNullPredicate>
                           | <IsNotNullPredicate>
                           | <ExistsPredicate>
                           | <Aggregation>

VariableReference        ::= <VariableName>

PropertyAccess           ::= <VariableReference> '.' <PropertyName>

PropertyName             ::= <IDENTIFIER>

BracketedValueExpression ::= '(' <ValueExpression> ')'
```

## Operators

The following table is an overview of the operators in PGQL.

Operator kind | Operator
------------- | --------
Arithmetic    | `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `-` (unary minus)
Relational    | `=`, `<>`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`
Logical       | `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`

The corresonding grammar rules are:

```bash
ArithmeticExpression ::= <Addition>
                       | <Subtraction>
                       | <Multiplication>
                       | <Division>
                       | <Modulo>
                       | <UnaryMinus>

Addition             ::= <ValueExpression> '+' <ValueExpression>
Subtraction          ::= <ValueExpression> '-' <ValueExpression>
Multiplication       ::= <ValueExpression> '*' <ValueExpression>
Division             ::= <ValueExpression> '/' <ValueExpression>
Modulo               ::= <ValueExpression> '%' <ValueExpression>
UnaryMinus           ::= '-' <ValueExpression>

RelationalExpression ::= <Equals>
                       | <NotEquals>
                       | <Greater>
                       | <GreaterEqual>
                       | <Less>
                       | <LessEquals>

Equals               ::= <ValueExpression> '=' <ValueExpression>

NotEquals            ::= <ValueExpression> '<>' <ValueExpression>

Greater              ::= <ValueExpression> '>' <ValueExpression>

GreaterEqual         ::= <ValueExpression> '>=' <ValueExpression>

Less                 ::= <ValueExpression> '<' <ValueExpression>

LessEquals           ::= <ValueExpression> '<=' <ValueExpression>

LogicalExpression    ::= <And>
                       | <Or>
                       | <Not>

And                  ::= <ValueExpression> 'AND' <ValueExpression>

Or                   ::= <ValueExpression> 'OR' <ValueExpression>

Not                  ::= 'NOT' <ValueExpression>
```

The supported input types and corresponding return types are as follows:

Operator                                            | type of A (and B)                                                                                   | Return Type
--------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -----------
A `+` B<br>A `-` B<br>A `*` B<br>A `/` B<br>A `%` B | numeric                                                                                             | numeric*
`-`A (unary minus)                                  | numeric                                                                                             | type of A

A `<` B<br>A `>` B<br>A `<=` B<br>A `>=` B          | numeric,<br>date, time (with timezone), timestamp (with timezone)                                   | boolean
`NOT` A<br>A `AND` B<br>A `OR` B                    | boolean                                                                                             | boolean

*For precision and scale, see [Implicit Type Conversion](#implicit-type-conversion). 

### Comparison of Temporal Values with Timezones

Binary operations are only allowed if both operands are of the same type, with the following two exceptions:

- _time_ values can be compared to _time with timezone_ values
- _timestamp_ values can be compared to _timestamp with timezone_ values

To compare such _time(stamp) with timezone_ values to other time(stamp) values (with or without timezone), values are first normalized to have the same timezone, before they are compared.
Comparison with other operand type combinations, such as dates and timestamp, is not possible. However, it is possible to cast between e.g. dates and timestamps (see [Explicit Type Conversion (CAST)](#explicit-type-conversion-cast)).

### Operator Precedence

Operator precedences are shown in the following list, from highest precedence to the lowest. An operator on a higher level (e.g. level 1) is evaluated before an operator on a lower level (e.g. level 2).

Level | Operator Precedence
----- | ---
1     | `-` (unary minus)
2     | `*`, `/`, `%`
3     | `+`, `-`
4     | `=`, `<>`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`
5     | `NOT`
6     | `AND`
7     | `OR`

## Null Values

The property graph data model does not allow properties with `null` value. Instead, missing or undefined data can be modeled through the _absence_ of properties.
A `null` value is generated when trying to access a property of a vertex or edge wile the property appears to be missing.
Three-valued logic applies when `null` values appear in computation.

### Three-Valued Logic

An operator returns `null` if one of its operands yields `null`, with an exception for `AND` and `OR`. This is shown in the following table:

Operator                                            | Result when A is null                         | Result when B is null                          | Result when A and B are null
--------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------
A `+` `-` `*` `/` `%` `=` `<>` `<` `>` `<=` `>=` B  | `null`                                        | `null`                                         | `null`
A `AND` B                                           | `false` if B yields `false`, `null` otherwise | `false` if A yields `false`, `null` otherwise  | `null`
A `OR` B                                            | `true` if B yields `true`, `null` otherwise   | `true` if A yields `true`, `null` otherwise    | `null`
`NOT` A                                             | `null`                                        |                                                |

Note that from the table it follows that `null = null` yields `null` and not `true`.

### IS NULL and IS NOT NULL

To test whether a value exists or not, one can use the `IS NULL` and `IS NOT NULL` constructs.

```bash
IsNullPredicate    ::= <ValueExpression> 'IS' 'NULL'

IsNotNullPredicate ::= <ValueExpression> 'IS' 'NOT' 'NULL'
```

An example is as follows:

```sql
SELECT n.name
 MATCH (n)
 WHERE n.name IS NOT NULL
```

Here, we find all the vertices in the graph that have the property `name` and then return the property.

## Literals

The following are the available literals in PGQL:

```bash
Literal                      ::= <StringLiteral>
                               | <NumericLiteral>
                               | <BooleanLiteral>
                               | <DateLiteral>
                               | <TimeLiteral>
                               | <TimestampLiteral>
                               | <TimeWithTimezoneLiteral>
                               | <TimestampWithTimezoneLiteral>

StringLiteral                ::= "'" (~[\'\n\\] | <EscapedCharacter>)* "'"

NumericLiteral               ::= <UNSIGNED_INTEGER>
                               | <UNSIGNED_DECIMAL>

UNSIGNED_INTEGER             ::= [0-9]+

UNSIGNED_DECIMAL             ::= [0-9]* '.' [0-9]+

BooleanLiteral               ::= 'true'
                               | 'false'

DateLiteral                  ::= 'DATE' "'" <yyyy-MM-dd> "'"

TimeLiteral                  ::= 'TIME' "'" <HH:mm:ss> "'"

TimestampLiteral             ::= 'TIMESTAMP' "'" <yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss> "'"

TimeWithTimezoneLiteral      ::= 'TIME' "'" <HH:mm:ss+HH:MM> "'"

TimestampWithTimezoneLiteral ::= 'TIMESTAMP' "'" <yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss+HH:MM> "'"
```

| Literal type            | Example literal                         |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| string                  | `'Clara'`                               |
| integer                 | `12`                                    |
| decimal                 | `12.3`                                  |
| boolean                 | `true`                                  |
| date                    | `DATE '2017-09-21'`                     |
| time                    | `TIME '16:15:00'`                       |
| timestamp               | `TIMESTAMP '2017-09-21 16:15:00'`       |
| time with timezone      | `TIME '16:15:00+01:00'`                 |
| timestamp with timezone | `TIMESTAMP '2017-09-21 16:15:00-03:00'` |

Note that the numeric literals (integer and decimal) are unsigned. However, signed values can be generated by using the unary minus opeartor (`-`).

## Bind Variables

In place of literals, one may specify bind variables (`?`) to create parameterized queries.

```bash
BindVariable ::= '?'
```

An example query with two bind variables is as follows:

```sql
SELECT n.age
 MATCH (n)
 WHERE n.name = ?
    OR n.age > ?
```

## Functions

PGQL has a set of [built-in functions](#built-in-functions), and in addition, provides extension through [user-defined functions](#user-defined-functions).

The syntactic structure for built-in and user-defined function calls is as follows:

```bash
FunctionCall         ::= <PackageSpecification>? <FunctionName> '(' {<ValueExpression> ','}* ')'
PackageSpecification ::= <PackageName> '.'
PackageName          ::= <IDENTIFIER>
FunctionName         ::= <IDENTIFIER>
```

A function call has an optional package name, a function name, and zero or more argument. Function names are case-insensitive.

### Built-in Functions

The following is an overview of the built-in PGQL functions:

Signature | Return value | Description
`id(element)` | `object` | returns an identifier for the vertex/edge, if one exists.
`has_label(element)` | boolean | returns true if the vertex or edge has the given label.
`labels(element)` | `set<string>` | returns the labels of the vertex or edge in the case it has multiple labels.
`label()` | string | returns the label of the vertex or edge in the case it has a single label.
`all_different(val1, val2, .., valn)` | boolean | returns true if the values are all different (typically used for specifying [isomorphic](#subgraph-isomorphism) patterns)
`in_degree(vertex)` | exact numeric | returns the number of incoming neighbors.
`out_degree(vertex)` | exact numeric | returns the number of outgoing neighbors.
`java_regexp_like(string, pattern)` | boolean | returns whether the string matches the [pattern](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html)

Consider the following query:

```sql
SELECT id(y)
 MATCH (x) -> (y)
 WHERE in_degree(x) > 10
```

Here, `in_degree(x)` returns the number of incoming neighbors of `x`, whereas `id(y)` returns the identifier of the vertex `y`.

### User-defined Functions

PGQL does not specify how user-defined functions (UDFs) are registered to a database system and only considers how functions are invoked.

UDFs are invoked in a similar way to built-in functions. For example, a user may have registered a function `math.tan` to return the tangent of a given angle. An example invocation of this function would then be:

```sql
  SELECT math.tan(n.angle) AS tangent
   MATCH (n)
ORDER BY tangent
```

If a UDF is registered that has the same name as a built-in function, then upon function invocation, the UDF is invoked and not the built-in function. UDFs can thus override built-ins.

## Type Conversion

### Implicit Type Conversion

Performing arithmetic operations with different numeric types will lead to implicit type conversion (i.e. "coercion").
Coercion is only defined for numeric types. Given a binary arithmetic operation (i.e. `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`), the rules are as follows:

- If both operands are exact numerics (e.g. integer or long), then the result is also an exact numeric with a scale that is at least as large as the scales of each operand.
- If one or both of the operands is approximate numeric (e.g. float, double), the result is an approximate numeric with a scale that is at least as large as the scales of each operand. The precision will also be at least as high as the precision of each operand.

### Explicit Type Conversion (CAST)

Explicit type conversion is supported through type "casting".

The syntax is as follows: 

```bash
CastSpecification ::= 'CAST' '(' <ValueExpression> 'AS' <DATA_TYPE> ')'

DATA_TYPE         ::= {<IDENTIFIER> ' '}+
```

Note that the syntax of a data type is one or more identifiers separated by a space, allowing the encoding of data types such as `STRING` and `TIME WITH TIMEZONE`.

For example:

```sql
SELECT CAST(n.age AS STRING), CAST('123' AS INTEGER), CAST('09:15:00+01:00' AS TIME WITH TIMEZONE)
 MATCH (n:Person)
```

Casting is allowed between the following data types:

| From \ To               | string | exact numeric | approximate numeric | boolean | time | time with timezone | date | timestamp | timestamp with timezone |
|-------------------------|--------|---------------|---------------------|---------|------|--------------------|------|-----------|-------------------------|
| string                  | Y      | Y             | Y                   | Y       | Y    | Y                  | Y    | Y         | Y                       |
| exact numeric           | Y      | M             | M                   | N       | N    | N                  | N    | N         | N                       |
| approximate numeric     | Y      | M             | M                   | N       | N    | N                  | N    | N         | N                       |
| boolean                 | Y      | N             | N                   | Y       | N    | N                  | N    | N         | N                       |
| date                    | Y      | N             | N                   | N       | N    | N                  | Y    | Y         | Y                       |
| time                    | Y      | N             | N                   | N       | Y    | Y                  | N    | Y         | Y                       |
| timestamp               | Y      | N             | N                   | N       | Y    | Y                  | Y    | Y         | Y                       |
| time with timezone      | Y      | N             | N                   | N       | Y    | Y                  | N    | Y         | Y                       |
| timestamp with timezone | Y      | N             | N                   | N       | Y    | Y                  | Y    | Y         | Y                       |

In the table above, `Y` indicates that casting is supported, `N` indicates that casting is not supported, and `M` indicates that casting is supported only if the numeric value is within the precision bounds of the specified target type.

## Temporal Types

PGQL has five temporal data types: `DATE`, `TIME`, `TIMESTAMP`, `TIME WITH TIMEZONE` and `TIMESTAMP WITH TIMEZONE`.
For each of the data types, there exists a corresponding literal (see [Literals](#literals)).

In PGQL 1.1, the supported operations on temporal values are limited to comparison (see [Operators](#operators) and [Comparison of Temporal Values with Timezones](#comparison-of-temporal-values-with-timezones)).

# Subqueries

Subqueries in PGQL 1.1 are limited to existential subqueries.

## Existential Subqueries (EXISTS)

`EXISTS` returns true/false depending on whether the subquery produces at least one result, given the bindings obtained in the current (outer) query. No additional binding of variables occurs.

The syntax is as follows:

```bash
ExistsPredicate ::= 'EXISTS' '(' <Query> ')'
```
An example query is to find friend of friends and return the number of friends in common:

```sql
SELECT fof.name, COUNT(friend) AS num_common_friends
 MATCH (p:Person) -[:has_friend]-> (friend:Person) -[:has_friend]-> (fof:Person)
 WHERE NOT EXISTS (
                    SELECT *
                     MATCH (p) -[:has_friend]-> (fof)
                  )
```

Here, vertices `p` and `fof` are passed from the outer query to the inner query. The `EXISTS` returns true if there is at least one `has_friend` edge between `p` and `fof`.

## Subqueries without FROM Clause

If the `FROM` clause is omitted from a subquery, then the graph to process the subquery against, is the same graph as used for the outer query.

## Querying Multiple Graphs

Through subqueries, PGQL allows for comparing data from different graphs.

For example, the following query finds people who are on Facebook but not on Twitter:

```sql
SELECT p1.name
  FROM facebook_graph
 MATCH (p1:Person)                           /* Match persons in the Facebook graph.. */
 WHERE NOT EXISTS (                          /* ..such that there doesn't exists..    */
                    SELECT p2
                      FROM twitter_graph
                     MATCH (p2:Person)       /* ..a person in the Twitter graph..     */
                     WHERE p1.name = p2.name /* ..with the same name.                 */
                  )
```

Above, we compare two string properties from different graphs. Besides properties, it is also possible to compare vertices and edges from different graphs. However, because PGQL 1.1 does not have concepts like graph views, base graphs, or sharing of vertices/edges between graphs, such comparisons will always yield `false`.

# Other Syntactic Rules

## Identifiers

Graph names, variable names, and property names all take the form of an identifier that consists of an alphabetic character followed by zero or more alphanumeric or underscore (i.e. `_`) characters:

```bash
IDENTIFIER ::= [a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9\_]*
```

## Escaped Characters in Strings

Escaping in String literals is necessary to support having white space, quotation marks and the backslash character as a part of the literal value. The following explains the syntax of an escaped character.

```bash
EscapedCharacter ::= '\' [tnr\"']
```

Note that an escaped character is either a tab (`\t`), a line feed (`\n`), a carriage return (`\r`), a single (`\'`) or double quote (`\"`), or a backslash (`\\`). Corresponding Unicode code points are shown in the table below.

Escape | Unicode code point
--- | ---
`\t` | U+0009 (tab)
`\n` | U+000A (line feed)
`\r` | U+000D (carriage return)
`\"` | U+0022 (quotation mark, double quote mark)
`\'` | U+0027 (apostrophe-quote, single quote mark)
`\\` | U+005C (backslash)

### Optional Escaping of Quotes in Strings

In string literals, it is optional to escape double quotes. The following table provides examples of String literals with escaped quotes, and corresponding String literals in which quotes are not escaped.

With escape | Without escape
--- | ---
`'single quoted string literal with \"double\" quotes inside'` | `'single quoted string literal with "double" quotes inside'`

Note that the value of the literal is the same no matter if quotes are escaped or not. This means that, for example, the following expression evaluates to `true`.

```sql
'single quoted string literal with \"double\" quotes inside' = 'single quoted string literal with "double" quotes inside' /* this expression evaluates to TRUE */
```

## Keywords

The following is the list of keywords in PGQL.

```
PATH, SELECT, MATCH, WHERE, AS, ORDER, GROUP, BY, ASC, DESC, LIMIT, OFFSET,
AND, OR, NOT, true, false, IS, NULL,
DATE, TIME, TIMESTAMP, WITH, TIMEZONE
```

Keywords may not be used as `<IDENTIFIER>` (graph/variable/property names and labels).

Keywords are case-insensitive and variations such as `SELECT`, `Select` and `sELeCt` can be used interchangeably.

## Comments

Comments are delimited by `/*` and `*/`. The following shows the syntactic structure:

```bash
Comment ::= '/*' ~[\*]* '*/'
```

An example query with both single-line and multi-line comments is as follows:

```sql
/* This is a
   multi-line
   comment */
SELECT n.name, n.age
 MATCH (n:Person) /* this is a single-line comment */
```

## White Space

White space consists of spaces, new lines and tabs. White space is significant in String literals, as the white space is part of the literal value and taken into account when comparing against data values. Outside of String literals, white space is ignored. However, for readability consideration and ease of parser implementation, the following rules should be followed when writing a query:

- A keyword should not be followed directly by a variable or property name.
- A variable or property name should not be followed directly by a keyword.

If these rules are not followed, a PGQL parser may or may not treat it as an error.

Consider the following query:

```sql
SELECT n.name, m.name
 MATCH (n:Person) -> (m)
 WHERE n.name = 'Ron Weasley'
```

This query can be reformatted with minimal white space, while guaranteeing compatibility with different parser implementations, as follows:

```sql
SELECT n.name,m.name MATCH(n)->(m)WHEREn.name='Ron Weasley')->(m)
```

Note that the white space after the `SELECT` keyword, in front of the `MATCH` keyword, and in the string literal `'Ron Weasley'`, cannot be omitted.
